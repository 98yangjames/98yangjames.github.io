## What am I doing? 
The motivation behind creating this website is essentially being able to document my journey in both the tech world and the real world. I want to be able to convince myself that there is meaning in my life. That sounds pretty deep, but in all honesty I'm sitting in a coffee shop sipping on a latte at 2pm in the afternoon with nothing else to do. So if you're reading this, then sit back and enjoy ya boy's life story a little bit. This post is about my conquering of the Seattle Freeze.

**Whats happening now?** Recently, I moved up to Seattle in seek of change from the 19+ years of living in Corvallis, Oregon. Actually, that's not true. I moved up to Seattle because I decided to pursue a master's degree at the University of Washington studying Data Science. I feel like that sounds really great on paper - "James finally escapes the small town he grew up in and pursues a degree from a prestigious school in a big city". LOL, that's halfway true. I have indeed escaped the small town I grew up in, but in turn what have I sacrificed? This is my 6th year in college, so i'm definitely considered one of the older ones on campus. Freshman look like children, and my classes are full of working class people who have been in industry for a few years already. I have essentially no friend group here. I either hang out with people who are way too interested in what they do (you know the kind of people I'm talking about), or people who aren't even old enough to get into a bar. To answer the question, **I have sacrificed a sense of community.**

**Then go make some homies.** Making close friends in Seattle has been difficult because of both the environment I've been put in and the amount of time it takes. I'm currently working remote and go to school maybe 2-3 times a week at most. Project meetings are virtual and everything is basically done in front of a computer. People work 8-5 and there's essentially no water cooler conversation or Happy Hour events because everyone is either tired or live in another city. I have to put so much energy in just grabbing a drink with someone because of timing (and the fact that its constantly so cold and dark) that it makes me not want to go outside at all. This is my perception of the **Seattle Freeze.**

**Are these just excuses?** Maybe. But I've always thought of myself as more of a sociable guy, so there has got to be something going on right? Why the hell am I writing a blog about my life in a coffee shop in the middle of the day? Who's even going to read this? LMAO I'm probably going to send this to a few friends to see what they think. The Seattle Freeze is a mindset that has been normalized in Seattle. The concept that it is easier to just put in airpods and talk to nobody while doing your daily routine is the ultimate societal norm here. Of course there will be people who disagree, but I'm about to use some of my data science knowledege on your ass. I've lived here in University District for about a year now, and the sample size of people that I've actually gotten a smile back from or even just a conversation from is still countable on two hands. For me, that means I get approximately +/- 10 interactions every 365 days. The variance of my interactions is clearly impacted by my career and my current schooling; but if you really think about it, an elementary schooler probably interacts with more people than I do on a day to day basis (and those mfs probably can't even speak full sentences yet). **So no, it's not just an excuse. It's a mixture of behavioral habit and societal norm.**
